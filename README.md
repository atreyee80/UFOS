# UFOS
## Overview of Project: 
We will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.
Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings and to list all of the UFO encounters into and easily diplayable webpage for others to view.


## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.




## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
