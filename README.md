# UFOS
## Overview of Project: 
We will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.
Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings and to list all of the UFO encounters into and easily diplayable webpage for others to view.


## Results: 
The webpage give all the information related to UFO Sightings and all the records have been nicely presented in a table data.The year and the differents parts of US with durations and the shape of UFO .

## Summary:
The web page has been created  to show events that have occurred in the US as well as seeing their locations ,dates and the duration, shape and comments sections all adds up to give valuable informations which has been nicely recorded and displayed in a table,reading through this webpage will convey all the events that has  been happened in the past with detailed regarding the nature of the event. The drawback from the website is in its functionalty as it only references a file that has to be updated and not linked to database so events are more regularly updated as they occur in real time.

Two features I might add to this webpage would not only implement functionality as discussed above but to add a search engine to better find a location or certain type of event (shape, duration, comments etc.) for quicker use.
